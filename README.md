# Java Calculator Project 🧮

## Project Overview 🌐

Explore this Java Calculator project, featuring the `Calculadora` class for basic arithmetic operations. The `Principal` class serves as the entry point, offering an interactive menu for users to perform calculations. Dive into practical Java coding with this simple yet effective calculator.

## `Calculadora` Class Breakdown 📇

### Key Features:

- **Attributes:**
  - `n1`, `n2`, `r`: Store operands and results of operations.

- **Constructors:**
  1. `public Calculadora()`: Initializes a default `Calculadora` object.
  2. `public Calculadora(double n1, double n2, double r)`: Creates a `Calculadora` with specific values.

- **Methods:**
  1. `Somar()`: Captures two numbers via `JOptionPane`, performs addition, and displays the result.
  2. `Subtrair(double a, double b)`: Accepts two numbers as parameters, performs subtraction, and displays the result.
  3. `Multiplicacao()`: Captures two numbers via `JOptionPane`, performs multiplication, and returns the result.
  4. `Dividir(double a, double b)`: Accepts two numbers as parameters, performs division, and returns the result.

## `Principal` Class Operation 🚀

### Main Method:

- `main(String[] args)`: Entry point of the program. Creates an instance of the `Calculadora` class (`calc`) and orchestrates an interactive menu for users to seamlessly perform calculations.
